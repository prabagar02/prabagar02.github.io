	<p>
			How did you password protect your page?<br /> 
			I decided to code a simple script in javascript and incorporate it into my html page since
			it was the most simplest way to password protect the site. I used javascript to prompt a
			password dialog pop up box which simply takes the user input and compares it to the value of a
			password variable that i created.

			<br /> What new tag did you try? What was its effect?
			The new tag that I tried out was the script tag, which allows you to create a script that will be
			executable in html. This tab allowed me to use javascript to create a pop up box when entering
			the site.<br /> 

			Does your page look different on different browsers?<br /> 
			No. Since this site does not have any modified css and just contains text, the site looks the
			same on different browsers since there is technically no “design” to the site.

			<br /> How long did you spend on this lab?
			Around 20-30 minutes.
